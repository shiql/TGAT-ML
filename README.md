Codes for paper *A fusion model of temporal graph attention network and machine learning for inferring commuting flow from human activitity intensity dynamics*.

The paper propose a fusion model of temporal graph attention network and machine learning to infer commuting flow from temporal human activity intensity. The model first constructs a commuting network with temporal human activity intensity as node features. A temporal graph attention network is then developed to capture the spatiotemporal dependency. The learned node embedding is generated by using a machine learning method in the decoder. Finally, based on learned node embedding and machine learning method used in the decoder, the commuting flow intensity is estimated.
